## Parallel Computing
- Parallel Programming: Message Passing Interface (MPI), Pthreads, OpenMP, CUDA.
- Parallel Filesystems: MPI_File interface.
# Projects
1. Constructed a C program that specifically “simulates” a 4,096 bit Carry Lookahead Adder using 8 bit blocks.
1. Parallel C Program for a Carry-Lookahead Adder Using MPI
1. Develop a point-2-point message version of the **MPI reduce** operation and compare the performance of that version you develop to the collective version, MPI reduce across a variable number of MPI rank configurations.
1. Simulated Conway's Game of Life with **MPI parallel ranks/threads**, constructed heatmap using **MPI parallel I/O**
1. Parallel Matrix Multiplication  Algorithms (Cannon's and Strip algorithm) on **Blue Gene Q Supercomputer**.
